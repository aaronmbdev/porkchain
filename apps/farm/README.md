# Farm client app

This is the client app for the Farm.

## Available Scripts

To get started you need to first install the required dependencies. This is only required the first time.

```bash
npm install
```

Then we can start a development instance to start developing by typing:

```bash
npm start
```

Once we're ready to deploy, we will need an optimized production build. We can run the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```
